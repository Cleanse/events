# Events Plugin (WIP)
A round-robin and bracket events plugin for OctoberCMS.

### Round Robin Group Stage

- [ ] Teams can be either **manually or randomly** placed into groups.
- [x] Generate *Best-of-**X*** matches that match all teams in your respective group.
- [Yes/No] For the overlay, should advancing to the next match be manually controlled (due to scoreboard)?

### Tournament
- [ ] Generate *Best-of-**X*** single-elimination bracket.
- [ ] Generate *Best-of-**X*** double-elimination bracket.

###### Brainstorming
- !!! Take the *Config*, insert it into the 'event_type' factory, and do magic.
